# Week 1  

## Overview
In this lab, we explored the basics of programming with Python. We learned about programming languages, how to use the Python interpreter, create simple expressions, follow operator rules, handle errors, and understand essential programming terms. These fundamentals are crucial for future coding lessons.

## Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages vary in how close they are to hardware and their ease of use:

- *2GL (Second Generation):* Low-level languages like Assembly, close to machine instructions.  
- *3GL (Third Generation):* High-level, general-purpose languages like Python, C, or Java, which are easier to read and write.  
- *4GL (Fourth Generation):* Specialized languages like SQL or R, focused on specifying what to do rather than how.  

*Paradigms:* Python supports multiple programming styles, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional.

## Python Interpreter and REPL
Python code is run using an *interpreter*, which executes instructions line by line.

- Python provides a *REPL environment*: Read → Evaluate → Print → Loop.  
- Interactive mode allows testing commands instantly.  
- Key commands: print(), help(), quit().  
- The built-in help system explains syntax and object usage.

## Expressions and Operators
An *expression* combines values (operands) and operators to calculate results.  

Common operators include:  
- + Addition  
- - Subtraction  
- * Multiplication  
- / Division  
- // Floor division  
- % Modulus (remainder)  
- ** Exponentiation  

Expressions are the building blocks for calculations, decision-making, and loops.

## Operator Precedence
Python evaluates operations according to a hierarchy:

1. () Parentheses  
2. ** Exponentiation  
3. * / // % Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus  
4. + - Addition, subtraction  

Parentheses can be used to change or clarify the order of calculation.

## Common Programming Errors
Errors are part of coding and come in two main forms:

- *Syntax Errors:* Mistakes in the code structure, easy to detect and fix.  
- *Logical (Runtime) Errors:* Errors in program logic that may occur during execution, like dividing by zero.  

Programs should validate input and handle errors carefully.

---

## Key Terms
- *Source Code:* The readable instructions written by a programmer.  
- *Machine Code:* Binary code understood by the CPU.  
- *Interpreter:* Executes code one line at a time.  
- *Compiler:* Converts code into a program that can be run.  
- *Executable:* A program that can be executed on a computer.  
- *Expression:* A statement that calculates a value.  
- *Operators:* Symbols that perform actions on values.  
- *Operands:* The values used in operations.  
- *Syntax Errors:* Mistakes in writing code.  
- *Logical Errors:* Mistakes in program behavior or logic.

## Conclusion
This lab introduced Python programming in a hands-on way, teaching key concepts and common practices. Understanding these basics is vital for writing correct code and progressing to advanced topics.
